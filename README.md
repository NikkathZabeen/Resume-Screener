# AI-Based Resume Screener

## Overview
This project is an AI-based Resume Screener that predicts whether an applicant should be **"Hired"** or **"Not Hired"** based on their resume details such as skills, experience, and education. The application uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to preprocess the resume text, TF-IDF for feature extraction, and a machine learning model (e.g., SVM, Gradient Boosting, or any other model you choose) to make predictions.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface:**  
  A clean and responsive web interface for inputting applicant details.
  
- **Machine Learning Model:**  
  Trained using scikit-learn (SVM, Gradient Boosting, etc.) for resume screening predictions.
  
- **NLP Integration:**  
  Utilizes NLTK for text preprocessing and TF-IDF to convert resume text into numerical features.
  
- **Deployment Ready:**  
  Built with Flask and ready to deploy on platforms like Render using Gunicorn.
